## Bug Fixes

- __Card Click:__

During the testing stage, I discovered a bug where users could click on card tiles before the game had started, which made them unclickable once the game began. The issue was caused by the timeout function not being set correctly. To solve this problem, I added a no-click function during the timeout period to prevent users from clicking on the tiles before the game had started. After implementing this solution, everything worked properly.

- __Pop up message positioning:__

During the testing stage, I discovered a bug where the pop-up message was positioned incorrectly on the screen. To fix this issue, I made changes to the CSS code, which corrected the positioning of the pop-up message and resolved the problem.

- __Timer starting too early:__

While testing, I discovered that the timer starts counting down as soon as the Start button is clicked, which is earlier than intended. To address this issue, i modified the show all cards function by adding a timeout that delays the start of the timer until the cards are flipped to the back side. After making this change, everything started working correctly.
